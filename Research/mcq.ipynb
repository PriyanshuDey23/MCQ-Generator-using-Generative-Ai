Transformer can increase or decrease the voltage with \\ncorresponding decrease or increase in current. \\nWorking principle of transformer \\n \\n The basic principle behind working of a transformer is the phenomenon of mutual induction between two \\nwindings linked by common magnetic flux. The figure at right shows the simplest form of a transformer. \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive coils; primary winding and secondary winding. The coils are \\nelectrically separated but magnetically linked to each other. When, primary winding is connected to a source of \\nalternating voltage, alternating magnetic flux is produced around the winding. The core provides magnetic path \\nfor the flux, to get linked with the secondary winding. Most of the flux gets linked with the secondary winding \\nwhich is called as 'useful flux' or main 'flux', and the flux which does not get linked with secondary winding is \\ncalled as 'leakage flux'.  As the flux produced is alternating (the direction of it is continuously changing), EMF \\ngets induced in the secondary winding according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This emf is \\ncalled 'mutually induced emf', and the frequency of mutually induced emf is same as that of supplied emf. If the \\nsecondary winding is closed circuit, then mutually induced current flows through it, and hence the electrical \\nenergy is transferred from one circuit (primary) to another circuit (secondary). \\n \\nBasic construction of transformer \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive windings and a laminated steel core. The coils are insulated \\nfrom each other as well as from the steel core. A transformer may also consist of a container for winding and \\ncore assembly (called as tank), suitable bushings to take our the terminals, oil conservator to provide oil in the \\ntransformer tank for cooling purposes etc. The figure at left illustrates the basic construction of a transformer. \\n In all types of transformers, core is constructed by assembling (stacking) laminated sheets of steel, with \\nminimum air-gap between them (to achieve continuous magnetic path). The steel used is having high silicon \\ncontent and sometimes heat treated, to provide high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Laminated sheets of \\nsteel are used to reduce eddy current loss. The sheets are cut in the shape as E,I and L. To avoid high reluctance \\n\"),\n",

The circuit diagram for open circuit test is shown in the figure below. \\n \\nUsually high voltage (HV) winding is kept open and the low voltage (LV) winding is connected to its normal \\nsupply. A wattmeter (W), ammeter (A) and voltmeter (V) are connected to the LV winding as shown in the \\n\"),\n",

Now, applied voltage is slowly increased from zero to normal rated value of the LV side with the help of \\na variac. When the applied voltage reaches to the rated value of the LV winding, readings from all the three \\ninstruments are taken. \\nThe ammeter reading gives the no load current I0. As I0 itself is very small, the voltage drops due to this current \\ncan be neglected. \\nThe input power is indicated by the wattmeter (W). And as the other side of transformer is open circuited, there \\nis no output power. Hence, this input power only consists of core losses and copper losses. As described above, \\nno-load current is so small that these copper losses can be neglected. Hence, now the input power is almost \\nequal to the core losses. Thus, the wattmeter reading gives the core losses of the transformer. \\nSometimes, a high resistance voltmeter is connected across the HV winding. Though, a voltmeter is connected, \\nHV winding can be treated as open circuit as the current through the voltmeter is negligibly small. This helps in \\nto find voltage transformation ratio (K). \\nThe two components of no load current can be given as, \\n \\nIμ = I0sinΦ0   and    Iw = I0cosΦ0. \\ncosΦ0 (no load power factor) = W / (V1I0). ...

Voltage is applied to the HV side and increased from the zero \\nuntil the ammeter reading equals the rated current. All the readings are taken at this rated current. \\nThe ammeter reading gives primary equivalent of full load current (Isc). \\nThe voltage applied for full load current is very small as compared to rated voltage. Hence, core loss due to \\nsmall applied voltage can be neglected. Thus, the wattmeter reading can be taken as copper loss in the \\ntransformer. \\nTherefore, W = Isc2Req....... (where Req is the equivalent resistance of transformer) \\n Zeq = Vsc/Isc. \\nTherefore, equivalent reactance of transformer can be calculated from the formula  Zeq2 = Req2 + Xeq2. \\nThese, values are referred to the HV side of the transformer. \\nHence, it is seen that the short circuit test gives copper losses of transformer and approximate equivalent '),\n",

Thus, total transformer loss depends on volt-ampere (VA). It does not \\ndepend on the phase angle between voltage and current, i.e. transformer loss is independent of load \\npower factor. This is the reason that transformers are rated in kVA. \\nLosses in transformer \\n \\nIn any electrical machine, 'loss' can be defined as the difference between input power and output power. \\nAn electrical transformer is an static device, hence mechanical losses (like windage or friction losses) are absent \\nin it. A transformer only consists of electrical losses (iron losses and copper losses). Transformer losses are \\nsimilar to losses in a DC machine, except that transformers do not have mechanical losses. \\nLosses in transformer are explained below - \\n \\n(i) Core losses or Iron losses \\nEddy current loss and hysteresis loss depend upon the magnetic properties of the material used for the \\nconstruction of core. Hence these losses are also known as core losses or iron losses. \\n▪ Hysteresis loss in transformer: Hysteresis loss is due to reversal of magnetization in the transformer core. \\nThis loss depends upon the volume and grade of the iron, frequency of magnetic reversals and value of flux \\ndensity. It can be given by, Steinmetz formula: \\nWh= ηBmax1.6fV (watts) \\nwhere,   η = Steinmetz hysteresis constant \\n             V = volume of the core in m3 \\n▪ Eddy current loss in transformer: In transformer, AC current is supplied to the primary winding which \\nsets up alternating magnetizing flux. When this flux links with secondary winding, it produces induced emf \\nin it. But some part of this flux also gets linked with other conducting parts like steel core or iron body or \\nthe transformer, which will result in induced emf in those parts, causing small circulating current in them. \\nThis current is called as eddy current. Due to these eddy currents, some energy will be dissipated in the form \\nof heat. \\n (ii) Copper loss in transformer \\nCopper loss is due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.  Copper loss for the primary winding is \\nI12R1 and for secondary winding is I22R2. Where, I1 and I2 are current in primary and secondary winding \\n\"),\n",

It is clear that Cu \\nloss is proportional to square of the current, and current depends on the load. Hence copper loss in transformer \\nvaries with the load. \\n \\nEfficiency of Transformer \\n \\nJust like any other electrical machine, efficiency of a transformer can be defined as the output power divided \\nby the input power. That is  efficiency = output / input . \\nTransformers are the most highly efficient electrical devices. Most of the transformers have full load efficiency \\nbetween 95% to 98.5% . As a transformer being highly efficient, output and input are having nearly same value, \\nand hence it is impractical to measure the efficiency of transformer by using output / input. A better method to \\nfind efficiency of a transformer is using, efficiency = (input - losses) / input = 1 - (losses / input). \\nCondition for maximum efficiency \\nLet, \\nCopper loss = I12R1 \\nIron loss = Wi \\n \\n'),\n",

Transformer can increase or decrease the voltage with \\ncorresponding decrease or increase in current. \\nWorking principle of transformer \\n \\n The basic principle behind working of a transformer is the phenomenon of mutual induction between two \\nwindings linked by common magnetic flux. The figure at right shows the simplest form of a transformer. \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive coils; primary winding and secondary winding. The coils are \\nelectrically separated but magnetically linked to each other. When, primary winding is connected to a source of \\nalternating voltage, alternating magnetic flux is produced around the winding. The core provides magnetic path \\nfor the flux, to get linked with the secondary winding. Most of the flux gets linked with the secondary winding \\nwhich is called as 'useful flux' or main 'flux', and the flux which does not get linked with secondary winding is \\ncalled as 'leakage flux'.  As the flux produced is alternating (the direction of it is continuously changing), EMF \\ngets induced in the secondary winding according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This emf is \\ncalled 'mutually induced emf', and the frequency of mutually induced emf is same as that of supplied emf. If the \\nsecondary winding is closed circuit, then mutually induced current flows through it, and hence the electrical \\nenergy is transferred from one circuit (primary) to another circuit (secondary). \\n \\nBasic construction of transformer \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive windings and a laminated steel core. The coils are insulated \\nfrom each other as well as from the steel core. A transformer may also consist of a container for winding and \\ncore assembly (called as tank), suitable bushings to take our the terminals, oil conservator to provide oil in the \\ntransformer tank for cooling purposes etc. The figure at left illustrates the basic construction of a transformer. \\n In all types of transformers, core is constructed by assembling (stacking) laminated sheets of steel, with \\nminimum air-gap between them (to achieve continuous magnetic path). The steel used is having high silicon \\ncontent and sometimes heat treated, to provide high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Laminated sheets of \\nsteel are used to reduce eddy current loss. The sheets are cut in the shape as E,I and L. To avoid high reluctance \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='at joints, laminations are stacked by alternating the sides of joint.

Open circuit test and short circuit test on transformer are very economical and convenient \\nbecause they are performed without actually loading of the transformer. \\n \\nOpen circuit or No load test on Transformer \\n \\nOpen circuit test or no load test on a transformer is performed to determine 'no load loss (core loss)' and 'no load \\ncurrent I0'. The circuit diagram for open circuit test is shown in the figure below. \\n \\nUsually high voltage (HV) winding is kept open and the low voltage (LV) winding is connected to its normal \\nsupply. A wattmeter (W), ammeter (A) and voltmeter (V) are connected to the LV winding as shown in the \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='figure. Now, applied voltage is slowly increased from zero to normal rated value of the LV side with the help of \\na variac. When the applied voltage reaches to the rated value of the LV winding, readings from all the three \\ninstruments are taken. \\nThe ammeter reading gives the no load current I0. As I0 itself is very small, the voltage drops due to this current \\ncan be neglected. \\nThe input power is indicated by the wattmeter (W). And as the other side of transformer is open circuited, there \\nis no output power. Hence, this input power only consists of core losses and copper losses. As described above, \\nno-load current is so small that these copper losses can be neglected. Hence, now the input power is almost \\nequal to the core losses. Thus, the wattmeter reading gives the core losses of the transformer. \\nSometimes, a high resistance voltmeter is connected across the HV winding. Though, a voltmeter is connected, \\nHV winding can be treated as open circuit as the current through the voltmeter is negligibly small. This helps in \\nto find voltage transformation ratio (K). \\nThe two components of no load current can be given as, \\n \\nIμ = I0sinΦ0   and    Iw = I0cosΦ0. \\ncosΦ0 (no load power factor) = W / (V1I0). ... (W = wattmeter reading) \\n \\nFrom this, shunt parameters of equivalent circuit parameters of equivalent circuit of transformer (X0 and R0) can \\nbe calculated as \\n \\nX0 = V1/Iμ  and  R0 = V1/Iw. \\n \\n(These values are referring to LV side of the transformer.) \\nHence, it is seen that open circuit test gives core losses of transformer and shunt parameters of the equivalent \\ncircuit. \\n \\nShort circuit or Impedance test on Transformer \\n \\nThe connection diagram for short circuit test or impedance test on transformer is as shown in the figure \\nbelow. The LV side of transformer is short circuited and wattmeter (W), voltmere (V) and ammeter (A) are \\nconnected on the HV side of the transformer. Voltage is applied to the HV side and increased from the zero \\nuntil the ammeter reading equals the rated current. All the readings are taken at this rated current. \\nThe ammeter reading gives primary equivalent of full load current (Isc). \\nThe voltage applied for full load current is very small as compared to rated voltage. Hence, core loss due to \\nsmall applied voltage can be neglected. Thus, the wattmeter reading can be taken as copper loss in the \\ntransformer. \\nTherefore, W = Isc2Req....... (where Req is the equivalent resistance of transformer) \\n Zeq = Vsc/Isc. \\nTherefore, equivalent reactance of transformer can be calculated from the formula  Zeq2 = Req2 + Xeq2. \\nThese, values are referred to the HV side of the transformer. \\nHence, it is seen that the short circuit test gives copper losses of transformer and approximate equivalent '), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content=\"resistance and reactance of the transformer. \\n \\nWhy Transformers are rated in kVA? \\nFrom the above transformer tests, it can be seen that Cu loss of a transformer depends on current, and \\niron loss depends on voltage. Thus, total transformer loss depends on volt-ampere (VA). It does not \\ndepend on the phase angle between voltage and current, i.e. transformer loss is independent of load \\npower factor. This is the reason that transformers are rated in kVA. \\nLosses in transformer \\n \\nIn any electrical machine, 'loss' can be defined as the difference between input power and output power. \\nAn electrical transformer is an static device, hence mechanical losses (like windage or friction losses) are absent \\nin it. A transformer only consists of electrical losses (iron losses and copper losses). Transformer losses are \\nsimilar to losses in a DC machine, except that transformers do not have mechanical losses. \\nLosses in transformer are explained below - \\n \\n(i) Core losses or Iron losses \\nEddy current loss and hysteresis loss depend upon the magnetic properties of the material used for the \\nconstruction of core. Hence these losses are also known as core losses or iron losses. \\n▪ Hysteresis loss in transformer: Hysteresis loss is due to reversal of magnetization in the transformer core. \\nThis loss depends upon the volume and grade of the iron, frequency of magnetic reversals and value of flux \\ndensity. It can be given by, Steinmetz formula: \\nWh= ηBmax1.6fV (watts) \\nwhere,   η = Steinmetz hysteresis constant \\n             V = volume of the core in m3 \\n▪ Eddy current loss in transformer: In transformer, AC current is supplied to the primary winding which \\nsets up alternating magnetizing flux. When this flux links with secondary winding, it produces induced emf \\nin it. But some part of this flux also gets linked with other conducting parts like steel core or iron body or \\nthe transformer, which will result in induced emf in those parts, causing small circulating current in them. \\nThis current is called as eddy current. Due to these eddy currents, some energy will be dissipated in the form \\nof heat. \\n (ii) Copper loss in transformer \\nCopper loss is due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.  Copper loss for the primary winding is \\nI12R1 and for secondary winding is I22R2. Where, I1 and I2 are current in primary and secondary winding \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='respectively, R1 and R2 are the resistances of primary and secondary winding respectively. It is clear that Cu \\nloss is proportional to square of the current, and current depends on the load. Hence copper loss in transformer \\nvaries with the load. \\n \\nEfficiency of Transformer \\n \\nJust like any other electrical machine, efficiency of a transformer can be defined as the output power divided \\nby the input power. That is  efficiency = output / input . \\nTransformers are the most highly efficient electrical devices. Most of the transformers have full load efficiency \\nbetween 95% to 98.5% . As a transformer being highly efficient, output and input are having nearly same value, \\nand hence it is impractical to measure the efficiency of transformer by using output / input. A better method to \\nfind efficiency of a transformer is using, efficiency = (input - losses) / input = 1 - (losses / input). \\nCondition for maximum efficiency \\nLet, \\nCopper loss = I12R1 \\nIron loss = Wi \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='Hence, efficiency of a transformer will be maximum when copper loss and iron losses are equal. \\nThat is Copper loss = Iron loss. \\nAll day efficiency of transformer \\n \\nAs we have seen above, ordinary or commercial efficiency of a transformer can be given as \\n \\n \\nBut in some types of transformers, their performance can not be judged by this efficiency. For example, \\ndistribution transformers have their primaries energized all the time. But, their secondaries supply little load all \\nno-load most of the time during day (as residential use of electricity is observed mostly during evening till \\nmidnight). \\nThat is, when secondaries of transformer are not supplying any load (or supplying only little load), then only \\ncore losses of transformer are considerable and copper losses are absent (or very little). Copper losses are \\nconsiderable only when transformers are loaded. Thus, for such transformers copper losses are relatively less \\nimportant.  The performance of such transformers is compared on the basis of energy consumed in one day. \\n \\nAll day efficiency of a transformer is always less than ordinary efficiency of it \\nEMF equation of a transformer and Voltage Transformation Ratio \\n \\nIn a transformer, source of alternating current is applied to the primary winding. Due to this, the current in the \\nprimary winding (called as magnetizing current) produces alternating flux in the core of transformer. This \\nalternating flux gets linked with the secondary winding, and because of the phenomenon of mutual induction an \\nemf gets induced in the secondary winding. Magnitude of this induced emf can be found by using the \\nfollowing EMF equation of the transformer. \\nEMF equation of the Transformer \\nLet, \\nN1 = Number of turns in primary winding \\nN2 = Number of turns in secondary winding \\nΦm = Maximum flux in the core (in Wb) = (Bm x A) \\nf = frequency of the AC supply (in Hz) \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=' \\n \\nAs, shown in the fig., the flux rises sinusoidally to its maximum value Φm from 0.

Transformer can increase or decrease the voltage with \\ncorresponding decrease or increase in current. \\nWorking principle of transformer \\n \\n The basic principle behind working of a transformer is the phenomenon of mutual induction between two \\nwindings linked by common magnetic flux. The figure at right shows the simplest form of a transformer. \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive coils; primary winding and secondary winding. The coils are \\nelectrically separated but magnetically linked to each other. When, primary winding is connected to a source of \\nalternating voltage, alternating magnetic flux is produced around the winding. The core provides magnetic path \\nfor the flux, to get linked with the secondary winding. Most of the flux gets linked with the secondary winding \\nwhich is called as 'useful flux' or main 'flux', and the flux which does not get linked with secondary winding is \\ncalled as 'leakage flux'.  As the flux produced is alternating (the direction of it is continuously changing), EMF \\ngets induced in the secondary winding according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This emf is \\ncalled 'mutually induced emf', and the frequency of mutually induced emf is same as that of supplied emf. If the \\nsecondary winding is closed circuit, then mutually induced current flows through it, and hence the electrical \\nenergy is transferred from one circuit (primary) to another circuit (secondary). \\n \\nBasic construction of transformer \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive windings and a laminated steel core. The coils are insulated \\nfrom each other as well as from the steel core. A transformer may also consist of a container for winding and \\ncore assembly (called as tank), suitable bushings to take our the terminals, oil conservator to provide oil in the \\ntransformer tank for cooling purposes etc. The figure at left illustrates the basic construction of a transformer. \\n In all types of transformers, core is constructed by assembling (stacking) laminated sheets of steel, with \\nminimum air-gap between them (to achieve continuous magnetic path). The steel used is having high silicon \\ncontent and sometimes heat treated, to provide high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Laminated sheets of \\nsteel are used to reduce eddy current loss. The sheets are cut in the shape as E,I and L. To avoid high reluctance \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='at joints, laminations are stacked by alternating the sides of joint.

Open circuit test and short circuit test on transformer are very economical and convenient \\nbecause they are performed without actually loading of the transformer. \\n \\nOpen circuit or No load test on Transformer \\n \\nOpen circuit test or no load test on a transformer is performed to determine 'no load loss (core loss)' and 'no load \\ncurrent I0'. The circuit diagram for open circuit test is shown in the figure below. \\n \\nUsually high voltage (HV) winding is kept open and the low voltage (LV) winding is connected to its normal \\nsupply. A wattmeter (W), ammeter (A) and voltmeter (V) are connected to the LV winding as shown in the \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='figure. Now, applied voltage is slowly increased from zero to normal rated value of the LV side with the help of \\na variac. When the applied voltage reaches to the rated value of the LV winding, readings from all the three \\ninstruments are taken. \\nThe ammeter reading gives the no load current I0. As I0 itself is very small, the voltage drops due to this current \\ncan be neglected. \\nThe input power is indicated by the wattmeter (W). And as the other side of transformer is open circuited, there \\nis no output power. Hence, this input power only consists of core losses and copper losses. As described above, \\nno-load current is so small that these copper losses can be neglected. Hence, now the input power is almost \\nequal to the core losses. Thus, the wattmeter reading gives the core losses of the transformer. \\nSometimes, a high resistance voltmeter is connected across the HV winding. Though, a voltmeter is connected, \\nHV winding can be treated as open circuit as the current through the voltmeter is negligibly small. This helps in \\nto find voltage transformation ratio (K). \\nThe two components of no load current can be given as, \\n \\nIμ = I0sinΦ0   and    Iw = I0cosΦ0. \\ncosΦ0 (no load power factor) = W / (V1I0). ...

All the readings are taken at this rated current. \\nThe ammeter reading gives primary equivalent of full load current (Isc). \\nThe voltage applied for full load current is very small as compared to rated voltage.

Thus, total transformer loss depends on volt-ampere (VA). It does not \\ndepend on the phase angle between voltage and current, i.e. transformer loss is independent of load \\npower factor. This is the reason that transformers are rated in kVA. \\nLosses in transformer \\n \\nIn any electrical machine, 'loss' can be defined as the difference between input power and output power. \\nAn electrical transformer is an static device, hence mechanical losses (like windage or friction losses) are absent \\nin it. A transformer only consists of electrical losses (iron losses and copper losses). Transformer losses are \\nsimilar to losses in a DC machine, except that transformers do not have mechanical losses. \\nLosses in transformer are explained below - \\n \\n(i) Core losses or Iron losses \\nEddy current loss and hysteresis loss depend upon the magnetic properties of the material used for the \\nconstruction of core. Hence these losses are also known as core losses or iron losses. \\n▪ Hysteresis loss in transformer: Hysteresis loss is due to reversal of magnetization in the transformer core. \\nThis loss depends upon the volume and grade of the iron, frequency of magnetic reversals and value of flux \\ndensity. It can be given by, Steinmetz formula: \\nWh= ηBmax1.6fV (watts) \\nwhere,   η = Steinmetz hysteresis constant \\n             V = volume of the core in m3 \\n▪ Eddy current loss in transformer: In transformer, AC current is supplied to the primary winding which \\nsets up alternating magnetizing flux. When this flux links with secondary winding, it produces induced emf \\nin it. But some part of this flux also gets linked with other conducting parts like steel core or iron body or \\nthe transformer, which will result in induced emf in those parts, causing small circulating current in them. \\nThis current is called as eddy current. Due to these eddy currents, some energy will be dissipated in the form \\nof heat. \\n (ii) Copper loss in transformer \\nCopper loss is due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.  Copper loss for the primary winding is \\nI12R1 and for secondary winding is I22R2. Where, I1 and I2 are current in primary and secondary winding \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='respectively, R1 and R2 are the resistances of primary and secondary winding respectively. It is clear that Cu \\nloss is proportional to square of the current, and current depends on the load. Hence copper loss in transformer \\nvaries with the load. \\n \\nEfficiency of Transformer \\n \\nJust like any other electrical machine, efficiency of a transformer can be defined as the output power divided \\nby the input power. That is  efficiency = output / input . \\nTransformers are the most highly efficient electrical devices. Most of the transformers have full load efficiency \\nbetween 95% to 98.5% . As a transformer being highly efficient, output and input are having nearly same value, \\nand hence it is impractical to measure the efficiency of transformer by using output / input. A better method to \\nfind efficiency of a transformer is using, efficiency = (input - losses) / input = 1 - (losses / input). \\nCondition for maximum efficiency \\nLet, \\nCopper loss = I12R1 \\nIron loss = Wi \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\transformer.pdf', 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='Hence, efficiency of a transformer will be maximum when copper loss and iron losses are equal. \\nThat is Copper loss = Iron loss. \\nAll day efficiency of transformer \\n \\nAs we have seen above, ordinary or commercial efficiency of a transformer can be given as \\n \\n \\nBut in some types of transformers, their performance can not be judged by this efficiency. For example, \\ndistribution transformers have their primaries energized all the time. But, their secondaries supply little load all \\nno-load most of the time during day (as residential use of electricity is observed mostly during evening till \\nmidnight). \\nThat is, when secondaries of transformer are not supplying any load (or supplying only little load), then only \\ncore losses of transformer are considerable and copper losses are absent (or very little). Copper losses are \\nconsiderable only when transformers are loaded. Thus, for such transformers copper losses are relatively less \\nimportant.

Transformer can increase or decrease the voltage with \\ncorresponding decrease or increase in current. \\nWorking principle of transformer \\n \\n The basic principle behind working of a transformer is the phenomenon of mutual induction between two \\nwindings linked by common magnetic flux. The figure at right shows the simplest form of a transformer. \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive coils; primary winding and secondary winding. The coils are \\nelectrically separated but magnetically linked to each other. When, primary winding is connected to a source of \\nalternating voltage, alternating magnetic flux is produced around the winding. The core provides magnetic path \\nfor the flux, to get linked with the secondary winding. Most of the flux gets linked with the secondary winding \\nwhich is called as 'useful flux' or main 'flux', and the flux which does not get linked with secondary winding is \\ncalled as 'leakage flux'.  As the flux produced is alternating (the direction of it is continuously changing), EMF \\ngets induced in the secondary winding according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This emf is \\ncalled 'mutually induced emf', and the frequency of mutually induced emf is same as that of supplied emf. If the \\nsecondary winding is closed circuit, then mutually induced current flows through it, and hence the electrical \\nenergy is transferred from one circuit (primary) to another circuit (secondary). \\n \\nBasic construction of transformer \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive windings and a laminated steel core. The coils are insulated \\nfrom each other as well as from the steel core. A transformer may also consist of a container for winding and \\ncore assembly (called as tank), suitable bushings to take our the terminals, oil conservator to provide oil in the \\ntransformer tank for cooling purposes etc. The figure at left illustrates the basic construction of a transformer. \\n In all types of transformers, core is constructed by assembling (stacking) laminated sheets of steel, with \\nminimum air-gap between them (to achieve continuous magnetic path). The steel used is having high silicon \\ncontent and sometimes heat treated, to provide high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Laminated sheets of \\nsteel are used to reduce eddy current loss.

It can be given by, Steinmetz formula: \\nWh= ηBmax1.6fV (watts) \\nwhere,   η = Steinmetz hysteresis constant \\n             V = volume of the core in m3 \\n▪ Eddy current loss in transformer: In transformer, AC current is supplied to the primary winding which \\nsets up alternating magnetizing flux.

But some part of this flux also gets linked with other conducting parts like steel core or iron body or \\nthe transformer, which will result in induced emf in those parts, causing small circulating current in them. \\nThis current is called as eddy current. Due to these eddy currents, some energy will be dissipated in the form \\nof heat. \\n (ii) Copper loss in transformer \\nCopper loss is due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.

The \\nload can be resistive, inductive or capacitive. The current I2 flows through the secondary winding of the \\ntransformer. The magnitude of the secondary current depends on the terminal voltage V2 and the load \\nimpedance. The phase angle between the secondary current and voltage depends on the nature of the load. \\nOperation of the Transformer on Load Condition \\nThe Operation of the Transformer on Load Condition is explained below: \\n• When the secondary of the transformer is kept open, it draws the no-load current from the main supply.
